EVERYTHING THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE:

1. MAKE IT SO THAT MULTIPLE CELLS, REPRESENTING 30MIN/1HR INTERVALS WITHIN THE DAY COLUMN, CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED 
2. ALSO THOSE CELLS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE DIFFERENT COLORS (BLUE, RED, GREEN) 
3. CREATE A MONTHLY VIEW RIGHT NOW THERES ONLY WEEKLY AND ALSO ADD THE BUTTONS TOGGLING WEEKLY VS MONTHLY VIEW
4. MAYBE USE SOME JS LIBRARY TO SHOW THE CURRENT MONTH/WEEK AT THE TOP OF THE CALENDAR
